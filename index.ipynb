    "# Regression Analysis using Linear Algebra and Numpy - Code Along \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we have seen that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among data entities (variables). Linear regression is a highly important predictive analytical tool that most data scientists use in their routine analyses. Here we shall try to develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrices operations, quite similar to what we saw in previous lessons and labs. This lesson covers least squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "[You are advised to follow this link for a deeper mathematical and geometric understanding of the topic](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). Here we shall try to keep things in a more data oriented domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the role of linear algebra towards regression modeling\n",
    "* Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "* Develop simple linear algebraic models for simple and multivariate regression\n"

We saw a toy example in the case of simple linear regression , relating days to number of sales and calculated a function that approximates the linear mapping. We also introduced the case of multiple input variables for the case of multiple regression and described it as matrix algebra. In th next lab, we shall use these equations to solve a real world problem. "
